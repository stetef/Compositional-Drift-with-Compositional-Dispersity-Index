# Compositional Drift

This program tool allows polymer chemists easily to simulate the results of controlled polymerizations given all required reaction parameters (monomer amounts, monomer reactivity ratio, average polydispersity, ect.). The simulations use the Mayo-Lewis equation along Monte Carlo methods to predict polymer chain growth. The tool allows for rapid pre-experimental screening of reaction conditions along with critical post-synthesis analysis of the chain structure. Please refer to the [manuscript](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsmacrolett.8b00813) published in Macro Letters for more details on theory, implementation, and applications.

## Getting Started
The program can be accessed in several ways.

### Running via Executable

* Download and save the .exe/ .app file in the most [current release](https://github.com/vince-wu/CompositionalDrift/releases)

* Run the program as an executable by double clicking (certification is on its way)

### Running via Web App (Demo Version)

* Go to https://vince-wu.github.io/CompositionalDrift/ 

* Note that the web app does not have the full capability of the executable program

### Running Locally with Python 

* Download and install Python 3.5+

* (Optional but recommend) Set up a python virtual environment using `virtualenv`

* Clone the project into your local repository:

`git clone https://github.com/vince-wu/CompositionalDrift.git`

* Navigate into the CompositionalDrift directory and install all dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Run the program:

`python polymerApp.py`

## Built With

* Python
* Javascript

## Contributing/ Development
